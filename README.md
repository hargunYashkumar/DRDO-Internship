# DRDO Internship – Quantum Computing Algorithms (Qiskit)

This repository contains the Python notebook implementations of various quantum computing algorithms and concepts explored during my internship at **DRDO, Delhi**. The focus was on hands-on practice and understanding of foundational quantum algorithms using the [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) library.

## 🧠 Project Overview

During my internship at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), I worked on implementing and experimenting with fundamental quantum computing algorithms. The primary goal was to gain practical exposure using **IBM Qiskit** to simulate quantum circuits and understand their real-world applications in secure communication, optimization, and quantum cryptography.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Qiskit** (IBM Quantum SDK)
- **IBM Quantum Lab / Qiskit Aer Simulator**

## 📂 Contents

The repository includes the following notebooks:

| File Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Deutsch_Jozsa.ipynb` | Implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm – demonstrates quantum speedup for specific problems. |
| `Grover_Search.ipynb` | Grover’s algorithm for unstructured search, useful in speeding up database searches. |
| `Quantum_Fourier_Transform.ipynb` | Demonstrates QFT, the quantum analogue of classical Fourier transform. |
| `Quantum_Teleportation.ipynb` | Simulates the teleportation of a quantum state from one qubit to another. |
| `Superdense_Coding.ipynb` | A protocol for sending two classical bits using one qubit. |
| `QKD_BB84.ipynb` | Simulates the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution. |

> 📌 *Note: All simulations are run using Qiskit's built-in simulators. For real quantum hardware access, integration with IBM Quantum Experience is required.*
